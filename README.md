# Weather-Trends
Summary:

Analyze local(Boston) and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

Preparation:

Extract the data from the database using SQL.

Steps:

1 Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

2 Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
